# Computer Spacegames

When I was a kid learning programming on my ZX81 and BBC Micro (model B), the Usborne series of books where my source of reference. Usbourne books are still good today and my kids have quite a number. But Usborne have recently released PDF versions of these original books (not that I need the PDF as I still have the real ones). 

One of the great things about the programs in those books is that they are simple, perhaps repetative but they are easy to understand. But also critically easy to modify to learn about programming.
